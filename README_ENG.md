### Halic University, Electrics-Electronics Engineering 
### Communication Laboratory

**Lecturer:** [Merve Ayyüce Kızrak](http://www.ayyucekizrak.com/en/about/)

**Goal:** Perform basic analog and digital modulation types as practical and simulated. In theory, signals, and systems, communication theory, such as the realization of the methods learned in real-life areas and performances.Being capable of implementing them.

**Requirements:** Signals and systems, basic knowledge level of communication theory, the discipline of laboratory use are expected. In addition, *MATLAB* and *Pytho*n with applications to simulate the installation of the laptop computer is expected to come to class.
